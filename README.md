# Space Shooter
## Project Description
This is a fast-paced arcade-style spaceship shooter developed in Unity and written in C#. Players control a spaceship, navigating through space while firing at asteroids and enemies, dodging enemy projectiles, and collecting power-ups. If the game persists for too long, it enters Onslaught Mode, dramatically increasing the challenge.

The game was built using a C# game development tutorial as a foundation, but it was expanded and modified to include new mechanics such as power-ups, increasing difficulty, and different asteroid types.

## Features
- Spaceship Combat: Fire at asteroids and enemy ships while avoiding their attacks.
- Power-Ups: Collect items that enhance your laser.
- Wave Spawning System: Enemies spawn in structured waves controlled by IEnumerator.
- Onslaught Mode: If the game lasts too long, difficulty spikes to test player's skill.
